My name is Yan Shi [jæn35, ʂɻ̩35]. I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). I am under the supervision of Professor [Rachel Hayes-Harb](https://sites.google.com/view/speech-acquisition-lab/rachel-hayes-harb) at the [Speech Acquisition Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/speech-acquisition-lab/) and work in collaboration with Professor [Shannon Barrios](https://sites.google.com/view/speech-acquisition-lab/shannon-barrios). I am mainly interested in L2 phonology, phonetics, psycholinguistics, and language acquisition. In particular, I would like to investigate how naïve listeners and L2 learners of Mandarin perceive non-native Mandarin consonants, which in turn influences their spoken word recognition. In addition, I am interested in how Mandarin speakers perceive non-native speech contrasts (e.g., the tense /i/ and lax /ɨ/) and how they perform in spoken word recognition. 

Prior to University of Utah, I earned my M.A. degree in Linguistics in the [Department of Languages, Literature, and Linguistics](https://thecollege.syr.edu/languages-literatures-and-linguistics/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu). My two concentration areas include theoretical linguistics and language acquisition. I worked with Professor [Stephanie McMillen](https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/stephanie-mcmillen/) in her Diversity in Language and Literacy Lab in the [Department of Communication Sciences & Disorders](https://thecollege.syr.edu/department-communication-sciences-disorders/). Earlier than that, I earned my M.A. degree in Applied Linguistics and Language Acquisition in Multilingual Contexts from the University of Barcelona in Spain and an M.A. degree in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) from University of Bath in the UK.
